# PriceOi - PriceOye Clone

**PriceOi** is a dummy e-commerce web project inspired by the popular online store [PriceOye.pk](https://priceoye.pk). It showcases my front-end development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and basic **JavaScript**.

###  Unique Twist:
To make the project more fun and engaging, I’ve themed it around one of my favorite anime characters — **Luffy** from One Piece — merging entertainment with work.

###  Tech Stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic functionality)
  
###  Features:
- Responsive layout
- Dummy product listings (inspired by PriceOye)
- Themed elements using One Piece character art
- Multiple pages (Home, Products, etc.)
